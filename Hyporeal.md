## Process

For some context this was my final project for Harvard's deservingly famous
online CS50 course
and my first project ever of any substantial scale. Because of this there are
many points in this post-mortem that may seem obvious but to me this project was
incredibly formative. This is the spaghetti that set me on my way to becoming a
chef.

Basically, for context, right before I started this project I had just grokked pointers for the first time and was riding high on that
which should give some context to the hubris and ambition I put into
conceiving this project.
